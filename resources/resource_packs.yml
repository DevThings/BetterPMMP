resource_stack:

  #Resource packs here are applied from bottom to top. This means that resources in higher packs will override those in lower packs.
  #Entries here must indicate the filename of the resource pack.
  #Example
  # - natural.zip
  # - vanilla.zip
  #If you want to force clients to use vanilla resources, you must place a vanilla resource pack in your resources folder and add it to the stack here.
  #To specify a resource encryption key, put the key in the <resource>.key file alongside the resource pack. Example: vanilla.zip.key
